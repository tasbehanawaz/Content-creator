# Things people will need to know

Websonic is not Speech to Text. It's Speech to Action - meaning a user can say somethign by simpy pressing a shortcut in their browser and Websonic Assistant will take actions like generate a draft, analyze a profile, summarize an article, watch a video, explain a concept etc

## People are unhappy about

### Monica AI 

- Lack of transparent pricing and scammy behavior from extension vendors
- Real capability of the extension is somewhere around 20% - misleading marketing
- Cluttered UI like excessive popups: Several reviewers mention full-screen YouTube being ruined by scroll-bars or sidebars, or the extension popping up uninvited. 

## People care about

- Ease of use
- Ability to test our multiple models
- Frictionless experience that's intuitive
- Easy to use shortcuts for productivity (e.g. /shortcut in Perplexity)

## Differentiators

- Highlighting powerful models will be a big plus - people will lend more credibility
  - Auto-select the best model for each use-case

- Perhaps memory management? (Doesn't seem very important)

# Core features

## Two modes of input - Websonic works writh your unique style

Tired and Wired

In Wired mode, you take the charge and run your browser without even lifting a finger.

In Tired mode, you can type to Sonic and it will still do the things that you ask.

## Sonic Works where you do most of your work: In the browser

Most people perform their small tasks in the web browser. They're checking email, commenting on things, and they have Slack and Google Docs open in the browser. So, Sonic also lives in the browser.

## Choice of modes for output (levels of Agency) - you control how much Agency Websonic gets

User can pick from

- Three modes: Clipboard mode, Edit mode or Agent mode

- Clipboard mode is when the response of the agent is copied to the user's clipboard automatically

## Style memory

It learns how you say things so you don't have to fine tune its prompts every time.

# Extension

## Context

The goal of this extension is to provide a single AI that is voice-based, very fast, and capable of accomplishing various tasks across different websites that you encounter in your browser. It eliminates the need to subscribe to a different AI that is built into each product.

## Branding strategy

- World's first truly hands-free AI

## Features to do

- Voice based shortcut that enables to simply trigger a message to AI with the attached page or select text as context

- Enable MCP servers that helps to add new capabilities e.g. drawing charts, integration with Notion etc (lacking in all extensions)
  - Then AI can not only rephase a blog as a script but also store that as a new page in Notion without interrupting browser flow

- Web search enabled by default which gives more reliable answers (this is missing in many extension that I tested)
  - This enables the AI to add additional context like searching for news or latest information to use in its responses

- Context aware menu on each website which provides easy to click options (like reply, summarize) that are updated based on usage

- Domain level rules (similar to Cursor rules) that enable a user to fine-tune the AI's tone and permissions per website

- Ability to import context from other chatbots like ChatGPT into the extension to give the AI a knowledge base to start with

- Conversations are stored grouped by website and the functionality used on the site like summarize, write, view etc
  - Memory is auto-created based on the websites, actions, and files uploaded by the user as context to the extension

## Discarded

- Powerful auto memory that user can see clearly and it is grouped based on topics and mapped to chats or messages

- - Store transcription of messages and additional context per site and utilize that as additional context for each request
