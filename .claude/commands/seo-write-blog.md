## Project Context Analysis
First, read and analyze the project files to understand the complete context:

Project: @${ARGUMENTS[0]}
Existing blog posts: `${ARGUMENTS[0]}/content/blogs/`

### Step 1: README Analysis
Read all README files in the project directory to extract:
1. **Project Purpose**: What problem does this SaaS solve?
2. **Target Audience**: Who are the primary users/customers?
3. **Key Features**: What are the main capabilities?
4. **Value Proposition**: What makes this solution unique?
5. **Industry/Vertical**: What market/industry does it serve?
6. **Competitive Landscape**: Any mentioned competitors or alternatives?

### Step 2: Content Strategy Analysis
Read the content strategy file located at: `${ARGUMENTS[0]}/STRATEGY.md` or `${ARGUMENTS[0]}/content/STRATEGY.md`

Extract strategic insights including:
1. **Content Pillars**: Established content themes and topics

## Phase 1: Strategic Topic Selection
Select a blog topic directly from the content strategy file based on the established content pillars, keyword research, and strategic priorities. Use the STRATEGY.md file as your primary source for topic inspiration.

**Process:**
- List existing blog posts to understand what content already exists
- Review the content strategy's content pillars and suggested blog post topics
- Identify 3-5 specific topics from the strategy that haven't been written yet
- Cross-reference potential topics with existing blog posts to ensure no duplication
- Select the highest-priority topic based on:
  - Strategic importance to content pillars
  - Keyword opportunity (already researched in strategy)
  - Alignment with target audience segments
  - Content calendar priorities
  - Uniqueness from existing blog content

**Topic Selection Criteria:**
- **Content Pillar Alignment**: Must fit within one of the established content themes
- **Strategic Priority**: Prioritize topics marked as high-priority in the strategy
- **Keyword Targeting**: Use keywords already identified and researched in the strategy
- **Audience Relevance**: Target specific user personas defined in the strategy
- **Content Gap**: Fill identified gaps in competitive landscape
- **Uniqueness**: Ensure the topic hasn't been covered in existing blog posts

**Selected Topic for Content Creation:** [Will be determined from STRATEGY.md analysis]

3. **Existing Content Review**: List the contents of `${ARGUMENTS[0]}/content/blogs/` directory to see what blog posts already exist and avoid creating duplicate content. Analyze existing titles and topics to ensure uniqueness.
4. **Strategic Topic Selection**: Select a topic directly from the content strategy's suggested blog posts and content pillars, ensuring it hasn't been covered in existing blog posts and aligns with strategic priorities
