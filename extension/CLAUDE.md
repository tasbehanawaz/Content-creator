# Context

The goal of this extension is to provide a single AI that is voice-based, very fast, and capable of accomplishing various tasks across different websites that you encounter in your browser. It eliminates the need to subscribe to a different AI that is built into each product.

# Branding strategy

- World's first truly hands-free AI

# Features to do

- Voice based shortcut that enables to simply trigger a message to AI with the attached page or select text as context

- Enable MCP servers that helps to add new capabilities e.g. drawing charts, integration with Notion etc (lacking in all extensions)
  - Then AI can not only rephase a blog as a script but also store that as a new page in Notion without interrupting browser flow

- Web search enabled by default which gives more reliable answers (this is missing in many extension that I tested)
  - This enables the AI to add additional context like searching for news or latest information to use in its responses

- Context aware menu on each website which provides easy to click options (like reply, summarize) that are updated based on usage

- Domain level rules (similar to Cursor rules) that enable a user to fine-tune the AI's tone and permissions per website

- Ability to import context from other chatbots like ChatGPT into the extension to give the AI a knowledge base to start with

- Conversations are stored grouped by website and the functionality used on the site like summarize, write, view etc
  - Memory is auto-created based on the websites, actions, and files uploaded by the user as context to the extension

# Discarded

- Powerful auto memory that user can see clearly and it is grouped based on topics and mapped to chats or messages

- - Store transcription of messages and additional context per site and utilize that as additional context for each request
